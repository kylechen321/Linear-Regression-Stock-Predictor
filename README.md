# Nike-Stock-Predictor

## DESCRIPTION
In this project, I created a webscraper that scrapes the stock price of Nike's Stock from Google finance. 
The value of the stock is then stored in a Excel Spreadsheet. The collected data is then used to create a 
Graph of the collected data's Stock prices. I then use Linear Regression to draw a line to predict the 
stock's Price over the next 10 days.

## LIMITATIONS
This code can only predict stock after collecting data for exactly one month starting at the first day of 
the month.
